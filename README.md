# markdown-e
A wrapper around markdown to allow for template code with input parameters 

## But Why?
Vanilla Markdown does a good job of this already but only for a finite set of desired inputs that one might want to do in the format, for example in code highlighting. What if someone wanted to input a custom designed block of html and css using markdown? This compiler is an attempt to provide that functionality.

## File Formats

### .mded
This is the markdown-e dictionary file. This is where one would define their custom elements and their input parameters. An example is in the project.
